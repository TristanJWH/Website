          <h1 id="title">About</h1>
          <p>In this section I will talk about me and this website, what it is, what it isn't and some more information about me.</p>
          <h2 id="What this website is">What this Website is</h2>
          <p>What this website is:</p>
          <ul style="color: #40484F;">
              <li>A place for me to store information</li>
              <li>A place for me to practice my HTML skills (which are admittedly limited)</li>
              <li>And finally, a place to share information</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What this website is not:</p>
          <ul style="color: #40484F;">
              <li>A place providing previously unknown information</li>
              <li>Necessarily correct, I won't always have all of the facts</li>
              <li>A website that can be relied on to exist into the future</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>What this Website is About</h2>
          <p>This website is perhaps not as well defined in its goals as many other websites
              The short answer is that it will be about whatever I want it to be about.
              This will mean that it will largely cover my interest but I will be keeping it roughly sectioned out mostly to make it easier to find information that you care out.</p>
          <p>I will cover (roughly):</p>
          <ul style="color: #40484F;">
              <li>Computer programs (mostly open-source)</li>
              <li>Linux</li>
              <li>Programing (but don't expect anything particularly advanced)</li>
              <li>Other computer-related projects</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>The Layout</h2>
          <p>The subjects that I cover will be sectioned out into a blog and an informational area.
              These sections will be linked together by the navigation bar.
              The informational area will be further broken down by subject and then the topic that is covered.
              The blog section will be broken down with articles that will cover specific areas.
          </p>
          <h2>Things to Expect</h2>
          <p>My website will have a few differences between it and other websites and it will be up to you to decide whether you think they are good or bad and so whether to stay around.
          </p>
          <p>In this section, I will tell you a bit about me, ways to contact me, request features or me to talk about certain subjects and tell me about bugs.</p>
          <h2 id="who am i">Who Am I</h2>
          <p>While I will not tell you any specific personal details, I will tell you a few less specific pieces of information.
             For example, I will tell you some of my interests and where you can find them on this site.
             I will also tell you that I am from the UK, so sorry Americans you have to put up with English spelling.</p>
          <h3 id="programing">Programing</h3>
         <p>One of my main interests is in the area of programming. For example, I enjoy basic programming in languages such as python and (if you couldn't tell yet) HTML and CSS.
            I enjoy this process and so will share the process with you the reader.
            This will hopefully mean that, if you stay around, you can learn how to program all of the same things.
            This interest will be found in the blog section of this website.</p>
         <h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
         <p>Another one of my main interests in desktop Linux. For example, I enjoy finding new, useful programs that work on Linux; I enjoy editing my configurations so that my computer can do exactly what I want it to; I hope you will enjoy learning about it all.
            This interest will help you to understand your computer and to make it do exactly what you want it to.
            It will be found in the blog section.</p>
         <h3 id="information">Information</h3>
         <p>This one might be a little bit weird but I enjoy finding out new information.
            Because of the limitation of far too little time, I will not be able to cover all of the information available so I will be covering a more specific slice of information.
            While I will listen to any requests to cover other information I will cover mainly maths, science and computer science.
            This interest will be found in the Information section and it will be further split up into the separate subjects such as maths and science.</p>
         <h2 id="contact">Contact Me</h2>
         <p>With this website, I want to hear from <b>YOU</b>.
            I will have a dedicated email set up for with website which can be found at the address <a href="mailto:contact@tristanhodgson.xyz">contact@tristanhodgson.xyz</a>.
            I want to hear about feature requests and requests for things I should cover, bugs and what you like about the website.
            But overall I just want to hear from you.</p>
         <h2 id="technical details">Technical Details</h2>
         <p>This section is probably of no interest to most people so I will keep it short it is about the technical details about this website.
            I am hosting this website on Vultr and have my domain name with Epik.
            I am writing the website with HTML and CSS but no javascript.
            This means that there are no trackers on this site (but this is not a promise) I did this because I like my privacy so I didn't want to take yours.
            Also, I am using Bootstrap in this website because it makes producing a good enough looking website very quick and easy even if it is sort of cheating.</p>
